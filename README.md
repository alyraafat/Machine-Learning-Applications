## Projects Overview

### 1. Credit Score Classification

- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to classify individuals into different credit score categories based on their financial history and other relevant information.
- **Skills**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification algorithms, model evaluation.
- **README**: For detailed project instructions, dataset information, please refer to the `Credit Scoring` directory.

### 2. Multimodal Heart Disease Prediction

- **Objective**: Implement a multimodal learning approach to predict heart disease using both structured and unstructured data. This project will require integrating numerical data with imaging data to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Skills**: Multimodal learning, data fusion techniques, image processing, model interpretation.
- **README**: For more information on the dataset, and evaluation metrics, see the `Disease Prediction from Medical Data` directory.

### 3. Speech Emotion Recognition

- **Objective**: Build a model to recognize and classify emotions from speech data. This project involves analyzing audio files to identify the emotional state of the speaker.
- **Skills**: Audio signal processing, feature extraction, deep learning for audio, emotion classification.
- **README**: Detailed guidance, including how to process speech data, model architectures to consider, and evaluation strategies, can be found in `Speech Emotion Recognition` directory.
